 ATtiny45 Motor Driver and 3x3 LED Matrix

 Overview

This project is a simple **educational circuit** . It combines a **DC motor driver (H-bridge)** and a **3x3 LED matrix** controlled by an **ATtiny45 microcontroller**. It also includes a **buzzer** and is powered through an external **power source with a switch**.


 ðŸ”§ **Note:** The software part of the project is not developed by me. This project mainly focuses on the **hardware design**.

 Features

* Control a DC motor using a custom **H-Bridge circuit** (built from 4x NPN transistors: 2N2222 or BC547).
* Display patterns using a 3x3 LED matrix**.
* Output sound via a **buzzer**.
* All components are **controlled by an ATtiny45**.
* Powered through an external supply with a **manual switch**.

 Components Used

* ATtiny45 microcontroller
* 4x NPN Transistors (BC547) for H-Bridge
* DC Motor
* 3x3 LED Matrix
* Buzzer
* Power Source (battery or adapter)
* Switch
* Resistors and wiring

 Circuit Design

The project is centered around the ATtiny45 which is responsible for controlling the motor direction (via H-Bridge), LED matrix display, and buzzer. The motor driver (H-Bridge) is built manually using four NPN transistors.

 Purpose

This project was built for **educational purposes** to demonstrate:

* Motor control using transistors
* LED matrix control via microcontroller
* Basic embedded systems design using ATtiny45
